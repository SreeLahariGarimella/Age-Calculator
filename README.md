# Age-Calculator

 It is an application where a user enters his date of birth as an input, and the application gives his age as an output. To create an age calculator, you need two dates(today’s date)(date of birth).You can either ask the user for both dates or just ask for the date of birth and use today’s date from the computer itself. Asking for the birthday only seems like a more user-friendly option.
